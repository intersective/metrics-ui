It can be helpful in identifying patterns and trends in large datasets, which aids policymakers to understand the scope and nature of the problem. For instance, data science can be used to analyse crime rates to identify regions where intervention is required. Such interventions would be tailored to meet the specific needs of each target population, thus the data plays a critical role. Data science can also be used in post-intervention evaluation: to assess the effectiveness of a policy intervention and predict future outcomes. Thus, enabling policymakers to anticipate potential challenges beforehand, and seek advantage of the opportunities.
","no comment","","Globalisation is evidently having a significant impact globally and will continue to shape future pathways. Mostly, increasing global competition, companies can use data science to analyse customer behaviour, forecasting sales, and marketing campaigns to inform business decisions. This will be crucial in maintaining competitiveness. From a policymaking perspective, it can be used to ensure a stronger evidence-based and data-driven decision making. Such valuable skills are an asset for opening up opportunities for professional growth, in a growing interconnected world. In addition, the advancement of the development of intelligence systems is heavily reliant on data science, which is critical in the automation of tasks and decision-making processes. This will become critical in the future, as time and efficiency -  time being the enemy - will be a competing factor for all careers. ","no comment","","My interest in developing skills in data analysis has been stimulated through the increase in demand for data-driven decision making, which requires skills of data analysis. Majority of occupations rely on data to make informed decisions, skilled data analysts are growing in demand, and becoming more of a 'need' in a world of a competitive labour market. Also, technology advancement has resulted in the rise of big data, with businesses and organisations demanding for skills data analysts who can effectively and efficiently analyse and interpret large datasets. All of the above, encourage my interest to develop and enhance my skills in data analysis.","no comment","","Strongly Agree","no comment","","Partially Agree","no comment","","Disagree","no comment","","Partially Agree","no comment","","Partially Agree","no comment",""
