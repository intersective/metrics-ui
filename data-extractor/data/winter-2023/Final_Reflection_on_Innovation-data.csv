This is crucial in innovation as a well-defined problem often points towards its solution.

Idea Generation: The module encourages learners to generate a wide range of ideas to address the problem and then select the best one. This divergent and convergent thinking is a key process in innovation.

Validation and Pitching: The module also provides guidance on validating the selected idea, developing a compelling pitch, and identifying key learning outcomes. These steps help in refining the idea and communicating it effectively, which are crucial for bringing an innovative idea to fruition.","no comment","","5","no comment","","1 - 2 hours","no comment","","NA","no comment","","NA","no comment","","Learning the different types of innovation, how to pitch effectively and succinctly, and how to appropriately present in an informative and persuasive way.","no comment","","Regularly Practice Idea Generation: Continually seek out opportunities to generate innovative solutions, both in your personal life and your professional work. The more you practice, the better you'll become at coming up with creative ideas and problem-solving strategies.

Seek Diverse Perspectives: Innovation often arises from diverse viewpoints. Try to surround yourself with people who think differently from you and learn from their perspectives.

Stay Informed: The more you know about a variety of topics, the more connections you can make, leading to innovative ideas. Keep learning and staying informed about a wide range of subjects.

Embrace Failure: Not every idea will be a winner, and that's okay. Each failure is an opportunity to learn and refine your approach to innovation. Don't be afraid to take risks and learn from the outcomes.","no comment","","Strongly Agree","no comment","","Strongly Agree","no comment","","Strongly Agree","no comment","","Strongly Agree","no comment",""
