They will try and understand why some people think the way they do why they hold the values that they do. Secondly they will be respectful at all times and be able to work with those they disagree with. For example a right wing conservative Christian should be able to work with a Marxist atheist and vice versa. 
Similarly a manager who is culturally intelligent will make reasonable exemptions based on the worker's religious and cultural needs whether thats allowing time off for a religious festival or allowing a Muslim to pray during their shift. ","no comment","","The world is globalising more now than ever before. As different cultures, religions and ethnicities converge it is guranteed that working will take place in a diverse context, one that requires cultural intelligence.

Sometimes he tells me of the different stories that people from various backgrounds have shared. With all these conversations, black cab drivers are fairly charismatic and are good listeners and speakers who can carry conversation effectively. By constantly engaging in conversation with passengers, he has some interviewer qualities . I suppose in this sense, my dad has some baseline skills. This is perhaps not the greatest answer, but with some logical considerations, I would say that my dad has a vast collection of memories and experiences with the different people he picks up in such a diverse, cosmopolitan city.","no comment","","I have been trying to learn French for the past few months as I hope to utilise it in a work setting.
