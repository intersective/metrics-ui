Whilst not directly applicable to the finance industry, he is someone I really respect for their problem-solving skills. 

He possesses a multitude of traits that make him a competent problem solver: 

Curiosity - Eddie is a student of the game of football, constantly looking to evolve his philosophy and improve his understanding. 
For example, after his departure from Bournemouth, he went around Europe learning from some of the best managers and refining his trade rather than just hopping straight into another job. He identified the defensive frailty of his Bournemouth team as its biggest weakness and went to shadow Diego Simeone, manager of Atletico who's known for the solidity of his team's defence and intensity. In his first full season back, at Newcastle, we conceded the fewest goals in the league, exhibiting the impact his time away from managing had. 
This open-mindedness sets him in good stead - equipped with the appropriate knowledge - to solve problems when they do arise. 

Attention to Detail - Howe is known for his meticulous preparation and attention to detail, leading specific training sessions for each opposition to nullify their biggest threats and expose weak areas. 

Patience - Howe is patient with his players, he doesn't rush new signings into the team until he is sure they have an adequate understanding of what he requires from them, and their teammates, in order to perform.

Resilience - Eddie has had to deal with numerous setbacks, most notably his relegation with Bournemouth in 2020. However, he didn't let this shirk his confidence and instead demonstrated his problem-solving abilities by working on the weaknesses in his game as I mentioned above. 

Leadership - Eddie exudes a quiet confidence both around his players and in dealings with the media, which has a compounding effect on the confidence of the players and the fans. This confidence comes hand-in-hand with humility which makes it respectable and he never comes across as braggadocious, but at the same time everyone knows he is in charge. 

He also has a multitude of skills which make him an effective problem solver: 

Analytical thinking - Eddie excels in his analysis of games and player performances. He analyses matchday footage in great detail, both of Newcastle and the opposition. He also identifies key statistics/data to identify areas where improvement is necessary. 

Critical thinking - He critically evaluates his teams' performance in-game and is not afraid to make the changes he feels are necessary. 

Communication - Eddie is an excellent communicator with his players and wider staff and ensures everyone on his team is on the same page. 

Collaboration - He is skilled in the art of collaboration, working in partnership with Jason Tindall. This close tie with his no.2 shows his humility as he does not need all the accolades for himself and accepts that another mind to bounce ideas off and collaborate with is rarely a bad thing. 
","no comment","0","I am interested in the skill of problem-solving mostly for my career, but also for the final year of my studies and in wider life in general.
