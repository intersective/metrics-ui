","no comment","0","Although I am from an international background (Hong Kong) and hence have had a decent exposure to multiple cultural backgrounds, I am ethnically fully Chinese, meaning that I was not surrounded by that diverse of a culture growing up. I think I have adequate knowledge of the large majority of cultures, enough to not engage in stereotypes, but I have yet to develop this into a strength that I can use in the workplace, to diffuse tension and recognising the boundary between cuture and what is accepted in society. Doing this would make me more employable and stand out more against fellow competitiors, hence I aim to better this through this section of the course.
